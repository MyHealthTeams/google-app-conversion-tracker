# GoogleAppTracking Plugin

Google App Install Conversion tracking plugin for iOS and Android. Phonegap integration for AdMob Conversion tracking.

## Preparation:

This plugin integrates with your AdMob account and AdWords campaigns.  See Google docs for more details.
See https://developers.google.com/app-conversion-tracking/.

## Installation:

Install with cordova cli:

    cordova plugin add https://github.com/insiderpages/google-app-conversion-tracker.git

Google SDK libraries are included in the plugin. You'll need to make sure the AdSupport.framework is linked in xcode for the iOS app.

## Usage

The plugin creates the objects `window.plugins.gapptracker` and `window.GAPPtracker` for convenience.

There's just one JS function: `track`:

    GAPPtracker.track(conversion_id, label, value, repeatable);

Values for conversion_id, label, value, and repeatable are generated by Google when you
create a mobile app conversion in your AdWords account.  After onDeviceReady, you can track the
conversion by calling track, e.g.

    GAPPtracker.track("0123456789", "abCDEFG12hIJk3Lm4nO", "0.99", "NO");
